# HCS Workshop 0 - Introduction to the Frontend
Starter Code for Spring 2022 HCS Workshop 1

# Setup
Before beginning, we want to make sure you can run your personal websites! In order to do this, please [download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) if you haven't done so already. Once you have VSCode downloaded, go to the nav bar on the left and hit the button that says "Extensions" (the symbol is four squares, one separated from the rest). When in Extensions, you'll see a list of things you may potentially install. For the purposes of this workshop, you will need to install the ```Live Server``` extension.

Next, please set up a Github account if you do not already have one. If you've taken a CS course at Harvard, chances are you already have one. If not, go ahead and do so: [Register for a GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home). 

Afterwards, download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Check the download by running ```git --version``` in your terminal (or Git Bash for Windows users). 

Then, still in your terminal (or Git Bash), run ```git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME"``` and ```git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"```, replacing your name and email, respectively. You should shoot for using the same email as your GitHub account. Although it shouldn't break if you use a different email, some bugs can arise. 

Finally, configure Git to use VSCode instead of vim. Run ```git config --global core.editor code --wait``` in the terminal (or Git Bash) and check if VS Code opens with the config document (donâ€™t change anything in the doc).

If everything goes well, you should be all set!
